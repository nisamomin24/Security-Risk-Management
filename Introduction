The Security and Risk Management module was designed to provide me with a comprehensive understanding of the key principles and practices in the field of security and risk management. This course covered essential topics such as the integration of security and risk, and the methods used to assess and manage these risks within an enterprise.

I learned about various methods of risk assessment, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches. This involved working with traditional risk models such as STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees, as well as exploring the increasing trend towards hybrid models that combine elements of multiple methodologies for a more robust assessment.

The module also covered common security standards, such as PCI-DSS, and their implementation in various business contexts. I gained insights into business continuity and disaster recovery solutions, learning how to develop strategies to prepare for and respond to potential disruptions effectively.
A significant portion of the course focused on understanding cybersecurity policies and governance. I studied legal and regulatory frameworks, risk management processes, and the development of security policies and incident response plans. Through case studies and practical exercises, I applied theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing my ability to address security and risk management challenges.
